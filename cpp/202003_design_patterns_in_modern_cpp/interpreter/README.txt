... write an expression processor for simple numeric expressions ...:

Expressions use integral values , 
single-letter variables defined in variables , 
as well as + and - operators only

There is no need to support braces or any other operations
If a variable is not found in Variables  (or if we encounter a variable with >1 letter, e.g. ab), 
the evaluator returns 0 (zero)In case of any parsing failure, evaluator returns 0
